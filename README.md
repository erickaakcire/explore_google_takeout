# Introduction

This document was created for the ICA 2022 Hackathon tutorial "Exploring Google Takeout's Search History as a Data Source." The goal is to make this a living evolving document during and potentially after the tutorial / exploration at ICA, so you can fork the repository for this document on Github, make your changes and submit a pull request or Ericka can add you as a contributor to the repository if you let her know your github user name, or just email menchent@american.edu during the tutorial if you are not familiar with using github.

The motivation for this tutorial is as follows: The vast majority of people who use the Internet use search to find information and resources. Search queries and the resulting page visits, combined with self-reported information about a topic of interest (e.g. politics, content creation, sales funnel, fandom), are an under-explored and potentially rich source of behavioral information that could be used in social science research of many types. Google's 'Takeout' service allows users to download their own data, including all of the search terms they have used and the resulting web pages they have visited from any device logged into Google.

The tutorial will show participants how to download and explore their own data, and come together to think about how we could incorporate this type of data into our research in an ethical and practical way.

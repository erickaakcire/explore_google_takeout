# Introduction

This document was originally created for the ICA 2022 Hackathon tutorial "Exploring Google 
Takeout's Search History as a Data Source."

The motivation for this tutorial is as follows: The vast majority of people who use the Internet 
use search to find information and resources. Search queries and the resulting page visits, 
combined with self-reported information about a topic of interest (e.g. politics, content creation, 
sales funnel, fandom), are an under-explored and potentially rich source of behavioral information 
that could be used in social science research of many types. Google's 'Takeout' service allows users 
to download their own data, including all of the search terms they have used and the resulting 
web pages they have visited from any device logged into Google.

Furthermore, seeing this data can help students understand the detailed personal information
that technology companies have about them. It can also help students to learn how to analyze
data with a dataset that they know well, their own behavior. 

The tutorial will show participants how to download and explore their own data.
Social science researchers can then come together 
to think about how to incorporate this type of data into our research in an ethical 
and practical way.
